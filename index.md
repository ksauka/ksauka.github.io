I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the Department of IT Convergence Engineering in Gachon University, Korea, and working as a researcher in [CVIP Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/gachoncvip/home), Gachon University. I have completed my master's from the same department (2019-2021). My undergrad was from the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from [University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB)](https://ulab.edu.bd/) (2013-2018).
My current research interests include camera sensors, 2D & 3D image processing, and deep generative models.
